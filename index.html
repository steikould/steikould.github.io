                        <div class="content">
                            <p>My professional and personal goals seems to blend together.
                                I've always believed integrity and empathy should be pervasive in all that I do. On top of this, I'm
                                accountable and continually drive work towards completion.
                                I used to work for an international consulting firm performing automation
                                work for complex data migrations, or financial data processing. I did very well but
                                not spectacular. So, later when my wife's career took off, I decided to get my master's and
                                started working as a Research Software engineer at Vanderbilt's Computer Science Laboratory.
                                Currently, I work as a data engineer at Gordon Food Services.
                                In the evenings and weekends I'm either playing some high-level competitive tennis with my men's USTA team, helping my
                                kids with math and science homework, or planning my next big trip to Mexico or South Korea.

This includes batch and streaming data pipelines, distributed data moving with Dataflow (i.e. Apache Beam), some composing with Airflow, and tons of research on data governance, lineage, metadata. I also dive into costs, efficiency, when the datalake didn't make sense, and some tools we developed to make things easier for everyone.</p>

The application also provides a dashboard to review and analyze vehicle or driver performance, passenger history, and integrates google authorization and secure APIs our MongoDB document database.</p>

While database replication is easy, there can always be factors outside our control that can make things hard.

                                <p class="summary">While Dash provides a simple interface for creating Python callbacks that can update the layout of the application, it does not provide an easy way to incorporate client-side JavaScript callbacks that can interact with the Python code. This can be especially seen when we started incorporating JavaScript libraries for drag and drop features and for firebase authentication. While I knew enough JavaScript to begin writing ClientSide Callbacks, working with these libraries required some workarounds. </p>

                                <p class="summary">The main reason I left my consulting job was the intense travel.  Some years, I might have been away for months at a time.  Most of my clients, were large manufacturing, skyscaper developers, large retail/restaurant chains, or software companies. One regret I have was not taking pictures of all the cool things I got to see.  How many jobs could you see how an automatic transmission is made one week, ride the elevator to the 70th floor of a skyscaper under construction in NYC the next, to being standing on the rooftop of a Target in Colorado because the manager wanted you to show you the view of the Rockies.  I was fortunate enough to work with so many different companies and meet so many personalities, it made me appreciate the art of products.  The beauty of an aluminum transmission part thrown away because it didn't meet specs, or the fact that target intentionally makes the entrance super bright to appear more <inviting class=""></inviting></p>
