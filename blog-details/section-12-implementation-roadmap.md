# Section 12: Implementation Roadmap

We propose a phased, 12-month implementation roadmap designed to deliver value quickly and build momentum over time. Each phase has clear objectives, key deliverables, and success criteria, ensuring the project stays on track and aligned with business goals.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

The goal of this phase is to establish the core data infrastructure and deliver an initial, valuable product to a pilot group of users.

-   **Objectives:** Establish the data backbone, implement basic feature engineering, and deploy an initial version of the dashboard.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   A robust sensor data ingestion pipeline for one pilot facility.
    -   A raw data lake with foundational data quality checks.
    -   An initial "Golden Feature Table" with daily aggregations for 10-20 core features (e.g., daily power consumption, average flow rate).
    -   A simple dashboard with time-series visualization capabilities.
    -   Initial data dictionary and platform documentation.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Data is flowing reliably end-to-end from sensors to the dashboard.
    -   The dashboard is accessible and usable by the pilot user group.
    -   Basic user queries against the daily feature table are functional.
    -   Data quality scores for core features are consistently above 90%.

### Phase 2: ML & Intelligence (Months 4-6)

This phase focuses on introducing the first layer of machine learning and AI-powered intelligence.

-   **Objectives:** Implement initial forecasting and outlier detection models and launch a basic version of the AI chat interface.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   Short-term (next 24 hours) power consumption forecasting models.
    -   Statistical outlier detection to flag significant deviations.
    -   A comprehensive data quality scoring system visible to users.
    -   A RAG-enabled Q&A interface with a limited knowledge base (core equipment manuals).
    -   An initial recommendation engine based on simple, high-confidence rules.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Short-term forecast Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is below 15%.
    -   Outlier detection precision is greater than 70% as validated by pilot users.
    -   Pilot users are actively using the chat interface for basic queries.
    -   The first set of optimization recommendations have been accepted and implemented.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-9)

Building on the foundation, this phase introduces more sophisticated capabilities and begins to fully realize the vision of self-service.

-   **Objectives:** Enable multi-level aggregations, deploy more advanced ML models, and roll out the self-service feature engineering workflow.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   The full suite of feature tables: real-time, operational, tactical, and strategic.
    -   Advanced forecasting models for multiple time horizons.
    -   ML-based outlier detection for identifying complex, multivariate anomalies.
    -   The user interface for the no-code query builder and feature validation tools.
    -   Pump relationship analysis and initial coordination recommendations.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Pilot users are successfully creating and saving their own custom queries.
    -   The feature engineering iteration cycle (from proposal to validation) is less than two days.
    -   Coordination recommendations are demonstrating potential savings of over 10%.
    -   User satisfaction score from the pilot group is above 7 out of 10.

### Phase 4: Optimization & Scale (Months 10-12)

The final phase focuses on completing the feature set, demonstrating significant business value, and preparing for an enterprise-wide rollout.

-   **Objectives:** Deploy the full recommendation engine, launch the scenario modeling workspace, and scale the platform to additional facilities.
-   **Key Deliverables:**
    -   The complete recommendation suite, including advice for hot/slow pumps, turn on/off decisions, and system-level coordination.
    -   The interactive scenario modeling workspace for "what-if" analysis.
    -   Integration of cost forecasting models.
    -   A fully populated knowledge base for the RAG system.
    -   Deployment and configuration for a second and third facility.
-   **Success Criteria:**
    -   Verified energy savings of at least 15% in the pilot facility.
    -   The acceptance rate for AI recommendations is over 60%.
    -   There are over 100 active users across the organization.
    -   The scenario modeling tool is being used in the annual budget planning process.

### Ongoing: Continuous Improvement

Following the initial 12-month implementation, the platform enters a state of continuous improvement:
-   **Monthly:** Review recommendation acceptance rates and user feedback to refine algorithms.
-   **Quarterly:** Add new features and enhance the dashboard based on user requests and evolving business needs.
-   **Annually:** Re-assess and retrain core ML models to prevent drift and incorporate the latest techniques.
