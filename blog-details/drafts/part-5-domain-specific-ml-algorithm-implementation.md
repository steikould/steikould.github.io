# Part 5: Domain-Specific ML Algorithm Implementation

An automated MLOps framework is the engine, but its power comes from using the right fuel: domain-specific machine learning algorithms. Applying generic models to complex industrial problems is a recipe for failure. The success of our intelligent pipeline system hinges on tailoring ML approaches to the unique physics and failure modes of different pump monitoring scenarios.

## Predictive Maintenance in Action

Predictive maintenance moves beyond scheduled inspections to data-driven health assessments. By integrating sensor data monitoring critical pump parameters—vibration, temperature, flow rate, and pressure—we can train ML models to predict potential issues long before they become critical failures.

**Real-World Case 1: Power Station Boiler Feed Pump**
In a coal-fired power station, the health of a boiler feed pump was monitored using ML models trained on bearing temperatures (drive-end, non-drive-end, and motor bearings) and flow rate. The models successfully learned the signature of normal operation and were able to detect the subtle degradation of a bearing **days before it would have led to a catastrophic failure**, allowing for planned, non-disruptive maintenance.

**Real-World Case 2: Oil & Gas FPSO Produced Water Pump**
On a floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel, models were deployed to monitor a produced water pump. By analyzing deviations in non-drive-end (NDE) bearing temperature and discharge pressure, the system identified a leaking mechanical seal. This early detection saved an estimated **£30,000 per repair** and, more critically, avoided a potential plant trip that could have cost between **£500,000 and £1 million** in lost production.

## Sophisticated Time-Series Feature Engineering

Raw time-series data is rarely useful on its own. The key is to engineer features that capture the temporal dynamics of the system.

*   **Sliding Window Approach:** We use a sliding window to extract statistical features (mean, stddev, min, max) from recent data, typically in 60-120 minute windows. This allows us to predict pump conditions 5, 15, or 30 minutes into the future. A dual-threshold labeling technique helps classify the health state (normal, warning, critical) accurately.
*   **Distance-Based Features:** A powerful technique for anomaly detection is to calculate the deviation of current sensor readings from a learned "normal state" mean. This distance becomes a critical feature, quantifying exactly how far the pump is operating from its optimal baseline.
*   **Handling Imbalanced Datasets:** In industrial settings, failures are rare. This creates a heavily imbalanced dataset where a naive model might achieve high accuracy by simply always predicting "normal." We use techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to create synthetic examples of failure events, balancing the dataset and training more robust models.

## Matching the Algorithm to the Use Case

Our metadata-driven approach allows us to select the best algorithm for the specific task at hand:

*   **Vibration Analysis:** To move beyond simple anomaly detection to classifying the *type* of failure (e.g., bearing wear, misalignment, impeller damage), we use multi-class classification models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** For general health monitoring, we use algorithms that excel at learning a baseline of normal behavior and flagging any pattern that deviates from it. This provides operators with proactive alerts to investigate potential issues.
*   **Efficiency Optimization:** To reduce energy consumption, we use **regression models** to predict continuous performance metrics, such as energy usage per unit of flow. This allows operators to identify and correct inefficient operating conditions in real-time.

By combining these domain-specific techniques, we build a system that is not only predictive but also diagnostic, providing deep insights into the health and performance of critical assets.
